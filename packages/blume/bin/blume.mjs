//
// The published package ships a Node-compatible bundle at dist/cli/index.js
// (built by scripts/build.ts) and the launcher prefers it. When it is absent —
// e.g. running from a source checkout — it falls back to the TypeScript source,
// which requires a TS-aware runtime such as Bun (`bun bin/blume.mjs <cmd>`).
