 * Downlevel `<Changelog />` to the release list it renders.
 *
 * The generated `/changelog` page publishes its list through
 * `buildChangelogIndexMarkdown`, but a hand-written page that owns the route
 * instead goes through the component downleveler — which leaves a tag it has
 * no serializer for exactly as written. Without this, moving to an authored
 * page would publish a literal `<Changelog />` to `/changelog.md`,
 * llms-full.txt, MCP `get_page` and the search corpus, and an agent would see
 * no releases at all.
 *
 * The list is the same one the mirror publishes, so both routes to a changelog
 * index — generated or authored — reach agents identically.
