#!/usr/bin/env bun
// Build the Node-runnable CLI and the public-API type declarations into dist/.
//
// Blume ships its Astro runtime (components, theme, integration, markdown
// processors) as source: the consumer's Astro/Vite pipeline compiles those, and
// Tailwind's `@source` scans the package's component source for class names. The
// only code that runs *outside* a transpiler is the CLI entry, so that is the
// only thing that needs bundling to plain JS for Node.
//
// Bun bundles src/cli/index.ts (and its Node-side imports) into
// dist/cli/index.js and externalizes every declared dependency — those resolve
// from the consumer's install at runtime.
//
// Separately, tsc emits .d.ts for the public entry points (`blume`, `blume/
// schema`) into dist/types/. Without them a consumer's tsconfig follows the `.`
// export into `src/*.ts` and floods their typecheck with errors it can't resolve
// (`.ts` import extensions, `node:fs`, the migrator's internals) the moment they
// typecheck their own `blume.config.ts` / `meta.ts`. The exports map points the
// `types` condition at these declarations while the runtime keeps resolving to
// source. tsgo stays the repo's own typechecker (`bun run typecheck`).
